Everyone knows this. So really, they can’t blame him when he went and disobeyed all three of those at once. It was expected, right?It’s not HIS fault he broke into the Justice League’s secret space station, and hacked most of their security, and then maybe, kind of, sort of… accidentally… kidnapped one of their sidekicks.Yeah, it’s not his fault at all.

His hate for the Capitol burns bright and armed with his contempt, obscure past, and charm, he enters the Games where only one of twenty-four tributes will leave a victor.Tom Riddle was born and raised in the Capitol under his father's influence. Training to become the Capitol's Defense Minister, he is given the task of mentoring District Twelve's two tributes. He becomes infatuated with the boy from twelve. The boy's secrets are his to own the truth to, just as he owns the boy. \n “Well, what is your name, dear?” She asks uncomfortably with a slight laugh, green lipstick covering her patronizing smile.\n \nHarry Evans is the name that’s on the tip of his tongue. That’s who he is here. But the Capitol will know.\n \nHe swipes his tongue at his bottom lip.\n \n“Harry Potter.”\n \nHe nods overexaggerated and condescendingly to the camera before the feed is cut.\n\n",

  "description": "\nSeverus Snape made two vows, one to himself, and one to Narcissa Malfoy. First, he would protect Lily Evans’ son with everything he had, even if it costed him his life. Secondly, he would aide Draco Malfoy in his task from the Dark Lord fully and completely, or it would cost him his life. Two vows, two mothers, two bonds, and two sons. Each pair completely opposite in every way, and yet just the same, too. Severus didn’t care to dwell on it. For all he cared, his life could just be a huge metaphor for something greater. He wouldn’t bother thinking about it either way. And worst of all, Severus was stupid. He was so, so stupid, that he had spent the past sixteen years in love with a dead woman, and for reasons behind even him, he saw himself in young Draco Malfoy. He saw himself in Draco, and so he went out of his way to stick him and Hermione Granger together whenever he had the chance. Why? Because in Severus’ warped, old mind, the Granger girl was an incarnation of Lily. And Severus would be damned if he didn’t get his witch in at least one universe.•••In which, a mother’s love is all it takes to win a war and bring two people together.“I once believed love would be black and white, but it’s golden.”\n",

  "description": "\nIt had been literal years since Harry had seen him, it shouldn’t still feel like this.The grief, the rage, the fear, the brokenness, everything came back like it was yesterday. Like he was twenty one and desperately in love, like his entire life was oriented around another person. And the devastation of being left without a word; the empty, expansive void that filled his entire body.He couldn’t stop watching him. Couldn’t take his eyes off his lithe form, so similar and yet different. He walked taller now, he was self assured in a way he hadn’t been. Open, smiling, like he actually knew he was worthy and it changed how he viewed other people. But he was still himself; clever and funny, still a little bashful when someone praised him.Harry wondered what else was the same. Wondered if his mouth still tasted the same, if his hands could still make Harry’s body go pliant and his mind go blank. He wondered if he still got giggly after sex. Wondered if earl grey was still his favorite type of tea. If he still hated tequila. Wondered what Harry’d done wrong and how he could have messed up badly enough that Draco left after three years together without a word.\n",

  "description": "\nSummary: Harry has always been attracted to his mum. And why not? She's not only smoking hot and insanely attractive, but also the woman who's always been there for him. He doesn’t think she’s interested in him in that way, of course. But he’s very wrong, two decades of raising Harry alone has left Lily very pent up, even more so because of her handsome stud of a son. She doesn’t like all those horny schoolgirls sniffing around him, so after a romantic dinner she drags him to a hotel.A smutty one shot with more porn than plot! Enjoy!Links to my profiles on other websites can be found in the Notes at the end of the chapters.\n",

  "description": "\nToo often when you have a project and more important matters arise, you're forced to put it down and pick it up later. Well that can't really be done when studying Tinker tech. It becomes volatile when left without maintenance. For Dragon, devising a solution by putting the tech 'on pause' had been quite the satisfying accomplishment. Annoyingly, surviving the apocalypse had only exacerbated the time crunch.Yet the issue remained, so she and Colin rebuilt after the end of the world in an out of the way part of the multiverse. They just never expected their first time capsule to be a cryogenic pod entrusted to them for safekeeping. Nor did Dragon expect to reboot in a time capsule of her own.And so, awakening to a future that seems dead set on driving itself into the stone age, what is she to do? What are they to do. Should she give into despair and shut down, or live on and do what she can, however she can? She wasn't alone, she had that at least, but the path she can see that would give them purpose? Taylor had let herself be consumed by her mission once before, Dragon can only hope that their new mission won't be so calamitous.(Working summary)\n",

That may have something to do with almost being killed at her old school, definitely has something to do with her father suddenly relocating her to Florida, and likely has something to do with Audrey and Noah latching on to her because she comes from Brockton Bay and that automatically qualifies her as a Final Girl.It may also have to do with all the murders going around, but, really, those are almost a secondary concern.\n",

Just WAIT until we toss aside the only female characters in the show and put all the focus on the two men that we're delusional enough to think might actually kiss in canon!!!! WOaH!!!!! Grimes did nothing wrong. Sherlock and John Watson go into the first Danganronpa game and they KILL Naegi for being annoying!!!!! And then they kiss!!!!! I liked Danganronpa ten years ago when there was only one game and a very small following on Tumblr and that makes me better than everybody else. Vivere by Mecna feat. Izi but I only like Izi's part.

Around six months pass between then and what happens with the Dark Elves. And Frigga died. She died, and it was Loki's fault.Broken from the realization, Loki forces their way through everything that happened after. Right up until they faked their death yet again. But, this time, they're finished.An archeologist appeared on Earth, having been seeking out dangerous artifacts around the globe for the past eight months. If anyone looked into her, they'd find nothing more than a blank slate. In fact, if people paid close enough attention, they might realize those dangerous artifacts often suddenly go missing not long after they are uncovered.Because the little naïve Midgardians always find ways to hurt themselves. Someone has to ensure the destruction stops.\n",

  "description": "\nI just want them to interact.They've been my Roman Empire for these past few weeks to the point where I needed to write this to get it out of my system.In some interesting Marvel comic canon, Kree women are born with the ability to psychosexually control men. They supposedly undergo a procedure to neuter this when they are young, but a few (1 out of 100,000) can also drain them of life force, as well. It is implied that this is also an aspect of a basic sexuality/function.There is a scene in The Marvels where Dar-Benn has Carol in a loose elbow lock from behind and although officially it's just the bracelet, my headcanon is that the bracelet reactivated and expanded this basic Kree ability, given that she totally did drain Carol.*eyesemoji*So this is an alternate universe where Loki picks up the tesseract and gets sent to Hala on a deviated Avengers' timeline in which Dar-Benn wins and enlivens her planet with both bracelets (none of the Marvels die tho).She is now the all-powerful Empress of Hala and has a Loki.\n",

Maybe it was because you could keep him on a leash, something most others lacked.Even Mobius had his fair share of comments along the lines of \"he really does follow you anywhere\" which was undoubtedly true.But having him follow you around like a loyal dog wasn't easy. No, quite the opposite. He was always trying to get on your nerves, enjoying every little reaction he got from you. Because of this, missions weren't all too easy and this one wasn't any different.\n",

  "description": "\nPeter's lost everything. His aunt, MJ, Ned, his home, and now he doesn't even have a roof over his head. Life is crashing down on him and, God, its so cold.__________________Blood keeps running in and along his suit, and he wonders as he moves if he needs to wash it. Maybe he can go to the laundromat at like, 3 am. People aren't watching other people's laundry that late at night, they usually just wanna go home. Eh, either way, he's got some stuff he needs to take care of. Maybe he wasn't lying to Robin after all. Peter's body is trembling as he swings, the air around him feeling like it's cooling down rapidly. His muscles keep burning, his hands tense around his webs. The lids of his eyes are heavy. Exhaustion similar to the type he felt the night before is sinking into his bones alongside the hunger and loneliness. He only realizes he's falling when it's already too late.\n",

Only to end up in New York, where he transformed into a pet mom and got a crush on the weird neighbour that would regularly turn up with new injuries, he couldn't quite explain to him. It seemed, like some parts of Harry's life were changing for the better again. He guessed it could have been that easy, if only his past would've finally left him alone.\n",
